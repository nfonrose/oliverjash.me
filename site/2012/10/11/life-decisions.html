Those experiences are moments of tremendous value, in that they can influence what we may spend a great majority of our lives pursuing.</p><p>At university, something I increasingly note is people who still don’t know what it is they want to do for a ‘career’. I also see a lot of the same people grounding their time at university on social bases. In other words, people who attend university to “have fun”, rather than attending with a profession in mind.</p><p>Students who I work alongside or of a similar discipline (multimedia) will probably attest to this more so than others from traditional subject backgrounds. New Media as an industry is young, and consequently everything about the education in this field is far from developed or properly understood. A lot of people seem to have fallen back onto this course, failing to find a more routinised job path, or just because of pure uncertainty.</p><p>From a very young age, school has us narrowing the choice of career paths, at which point our foresight is probably only made up of one set of things – dreams. In this sense, our education system is <a href="http://francispedraza.com/who-wants-a-job">much like an ‘assembly line’</a>.</p><blockquote><p>From 1850 - 2000, the world needed jobs done by humans. Today, we need far less. Very soon, we may not need any. And that is a good thing.</p></blockquote><p>I believe the reason why people are uncertain is because of the transition that is happening from a capitalist-driven labour market towards a society with <a href="http://francispedraza.com/who-wants-a-job">more opportunities and less jobs</a>. The education system is beginning to fall over. Careers are a 19th century invention.</p><h2>Encouraging Autodictactism</h2><p>To better prepare people for opportunities, I believe children need to be taught how to think, not what to think.</p><p>The biggest influence for my own autonomy is reading online. I cherish every single tweet, because I know that inside of that link, there could be a gem.</p><p>30 minutes of reading online – be it a blog post or a WikiPedia article – can change a lot of things, just like all those stories where a childhood fascination develops into something life enduring. I haven’t uttered the words “I’m bored” since I realised this. Just as any geek will probably tell you, <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2436">life gets more exciting with age</a>.</p><p>You’ll likely hear me speak bad words about the tuition I’ve received at university, but I speak nothing but good words for my time spent there on the whole. For me, university has been a pass to freedom. When I look at the routinised jobs people are studying towards, I’m thankful that my course is so broad and open-ended. It’s opened up my mind magnificently. Through light-touch management, I’ve learned how to think, not what to think – just at a hefty price.</p><p>I consider it a pity that the current education system has us making life changing decisions so early on. Ambitions don’t just exist as childhood dreams. They can be realised at all ages, if only education wasn’t so short-lived and routinised.</p><h2>Web Services for Education</h2><p>Twitter often has me inundated with content, screaming “here, look at this!” from all directions. In fact, the majority of my spare time is spent filtering through shared links, just to find the good stuff.</p><p>A group of web services that brings new ways of content discovery is flourishing. Services that make it easier for people to access the good stuff in the vast reservoir that is the web. <em>Our</em> technology can take a pretty good guess at telling us what to read based on things like social graphs at an incredible efficiency, compared to one studying a river of tweets by day and night (amen).</p><blockquote><p>There’s no reason why every healthy person living in a free and developed country in 2012, with access to all our technology and resources, cannot be a little Leonardo, achieving new heights of greatness and accomplishment.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what I’m most excited about on the web today. Bringing accessibility to the vast reservoir of content that makes up the web, and with that, more ways to learn.</p><blockquote><p>“Once you stop learning, you start dying.” — Albert Einstein</p></blockquote></div></article><footer class="l-footer island"> <nav><h1>Navigation</h1><ul class="nav-list"><li> <a href="/index.html">Home</a></li><li> <a href="/about/index.html">About</a></li><li> <a href="/blog/index.html">Blog</a></li><li> <a href="/archive/index.html">Archive</a></li></ul> </nav></footer></div> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery||document.write('<script src="/components/jquery/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script><script>var _gaq=[["_setAccount","UA-29838483-1"],["_trackPageview"]];(function(e,t){var n=e.createElement(t),r=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];n.src=("https:"==location.protocol?"//ssl":"//www")+".google-analytics.com/ga.js",r.parentNode.insertBefore(n,r)})(document,"script")</script><script>var _gauges=_gauges||[];(function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.id="gauges-tracker",e.setAttribute("data-site-id","506ece0bf5a1f50573000013"),e.src="//secure.gaug.es/track.js";var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script></body></html>
