My third and final year of university is now underway, and I have started to plan my research for my final project. Before I get on to that, however, here’s my ‘elevator pitch’ for a brief idea about what this project is all about:

> Regular Internet users follow feeds such as BBC News on Twitter; BBC News tweet links to articles, and people use those links to access and read articles on the BBC News website. However, tech savvy people read and follow BBC News with RSS. My idea is one interface for following blogs and reading articles — a timeline panel, the article view, and information about the author. It's really bringing RSS like behaviour into a nicer and more usable form. Add to that a social aspect — ‘follow’ BBC News. Currently people always share to Twitter or other social networks, and then you read the content either on the website or in an app like Pocket. If you could see what blogs your friends were following, what articles your friends were reading, etc., and then read those articles—all in the same interface—it would be a huge boost to the interactions in today’s blogosphere. The big idea is putting this all into one interface, whereby convenience will improve interactions such as sharing and content discovery.

As somebody who does a lot of reading online myself, this is solving a problem that I am very much aware of: dispersed content on the web, and not the right tools for managing and sharing links. That said, I will need to evidence to support my views in a wider context.

## Competition

My initial market research found six services which are potential sources of competition: RSS, [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/), [Fever](http://feedafever.com/), and [Kippt](http://feedafever.com/). Google Reader, however, is a service that branches out into many more sources of competition because of its centralised design and public API. Of these, I will include the most popular ones in my research: [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/), [Pulse](http://www.pulse.me/), [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com/).

These services aren’t directly competing with my concept, but at some level they provide facilities which are similar. Furthermore, Twitter and Facebook facilitate similar tasks (‘news’ reading from links to shared content), yet this is not their sole purpose. For this reason I will categorise my competition as two kinds of sources:

- direct — microlithic services that focus on content discovery and/or sharing articles
- indirect — monolithic services that facilitate content discovery and/or the sharing of articles in some other way

## Research Plan

The concept for this project began with several of my own claims/assumptions which I will need to prove through research:

* People read online.
* People read content from multiple sources.
* People discover articles online inside of networks (friends, family, etc.).
* People share things they’ve read online.

To give my research some context, I will resource the studies of third parties to provide quantitive data about patterns which exist in generic content discovery on the web.

Then, I will look more closely at the existing habits people have with regards to reading online. I will carry out a survey which will aim to answer questions such as: Do people read online? How often do people read online? How many websites does the average Internet user ‘subscribe’ to (follow)? I will also ask questions to spot where, how, and who by the competition is being used. From this data I hope to spot patterns in a similar vein to what I have bore witness to, such as people who actively follow the BBC News account — which just publishes links to articles — on Twitter. Correlations such as this would support my claim that people do use these services perhaps incorrectly.

I will perform my own heuristic analysis of the competition to gather information about the good and bad features, focusing especially on the interactions of content discovery and sharing within their interfaces. I will also perform a focus group with users of the direct competition, to investigate what people like and dislike about these services, and their opinions of how things could be done better, also with a focus on content discovery and sharing interactions.

## Concept Development

Using my findings, I will develop the overall concept, using the ideas in their current state to produce wireframes and storyboards (to demonstrate user journeys).

At this stage, I will pitch the developed concept to a focus group of people who are representative of the target audience. This research will help me to gather feedback and opinions about what they make of the concept. The outcome of this focus group will be to clarify the concept is on the right path and inline with the desires of the target audience.

The findings of this focus group will accompany a first prototype, which, together, will help to prove the initial ideas of my concept in a working state. This will begin an agile development process, whereby I will regularly perform focus groups to gather feedback about the product’s direction, and make subtle refinements to the product (in design or marketing) to reflect any findings.

The research plan outlaid above aims to mature the concept of the project, and will mostly benefit the interface design of the application, which is integral to the success of the product. I anticipate that only once the interface is solid in design can I begin to think about a marketing strategy, as things such as the logo and product name will likely reflect the design of the application’s interface.
