{% excerpt %}
Five weeks into my project, and I’ve performed a survey, a focus group, and my own market analysis. The research went well, and I’m just beginning to analyse my findings.

97% of people who responded to my survey said that they did some reading online. This suggests that I have successfully reached my target audience with the survey. What’s more, my three focus group participants are all Twitter users, so that too is representative of my target audience.

I have also done a lot of research online to see what studies other might support my claim that reading online is fragmented. There seems to be a consensus that usage of RSS feed readers are declining, and social networking sites such as Twitter are rising in their place. I anticipate my findings will support this claim, as well as insight into why such a transition is occurring.

A quick skim over my survey responses makes me think that there won’t be any findings that fundamentally influence my concept. Rather, it looks like my findings will nicely support the claims I started with.
