{% excerpt %}
I have now finished writing up my findings from my market research. It was a difficult task, combining research from several sources and condensing it into a few thousand words. Despite the fact I could add more evidence to support my claims, I feel confident that I have given the strongest points in my report.

My findings not only proved my assumptions to be correct, but they have also somewhat informed the concept and developed it. One focus group participant suggested that I implement the service on top of Twitter, so that people can follow Twitter users if they don’t yet have an account on the service – pulling in any tweets that contain links to potential content. I like this idea because it provides ease of use, right from the start.

I’m really looking forward to designing the user interface, and how this thing actually works. This is an idea I’ve been thinking about for two years, and now that the time has come to implement my learnings and actually build it, it’s exciting for me. The web application I have proposed is actually one I would use myself on a daily basis, as it is solving a problem I have experienced myself, first-hand.

Looking forward, it’s going to be hard to submit a ‘brand’ identity before development. I would prefer to let the product influence the identity, and that won’t be certain until after much user testing.
