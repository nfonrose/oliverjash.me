{% excerpt %}
Looking back on 2012, I:

* built my first computer (with thanks to Mike);
* got an acoustic guitar, and learned how to make it talk (sort of; with thanks to Mike, again);
* worked in my first proper role as a web developer at Clock
* … during which I worked on two of my biggest projects, which involved conquering OOCSS and, finally, Backbone;
* travelled to Paris, Berlin, the Lake District, and many UK towns and cities – some I forget, and the others are too many to list;
* got my first personal website online;
* got fairly comfortable with Vim, and much more comfortable with the command line, shell scripting, Git, etc.;
* dauntingly, yet contentedly, continued to realise how much I actually do not know (and maybe never will);
* sadly lost my best friend – our Irish Setter, Claudia (aged 12);
* met and acquainted with Paddy, our new rescued Irish Setter, and also now my father's best friend.

My New Year’s resolution will be to discover, try, and like at least four things I never thought I would try. (Music, outdoor activities… whatever!)
