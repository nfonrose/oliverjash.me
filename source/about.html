    <p>My name is Oliver, and I&rsquo;m from a small town towards the south of England called Flitwick. Ever since I was about 13-years-old, I have lived and breathed the web.</p>

    <p>Now at 20-years-old, I reside in London, England, where I make JavaScript web applications at <a href="http://twitter.com/guardian">@guardian</a>. In my spare time, I'm also hard at work on my first startup.</p>

    <p>I contribute code to <a href="http://OliverJAsh.github.com/">GitHub</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/oliverjash.me">code for this site</a> is up on there, too, <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/oliverjash.me">if you're interested</a>. I post snippets of my thoughts on <a href="http://twitter.com/OliverJAsh">Twitter</a>. Away from the computer, I take an interest in travelling and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/OliverJAsh" title="See my photos on Flickr">some photography</a>. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or via <a href="http://twitter.com/OliverJAsh">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <p>I really believe that computers can improve lives. I bear witness to it every day. But I believe we need to make technology more human. As a web developer, I want to be a part of that revolution.</p>
