    <h1 class="post-title">About</h1>

    <p><img src="/images/about-page-portrait.jpg" class="img-right img-2-5">My name is Oliver, and I&rsquo;m from a small town towards the south of England called Flitwick. Ever since I was about 13-years-old, I have lived and breathed the web.</p>

    <p>Now at 20-years-old, I reside in Leeds, England, where I&rsquo;m studying in my third year at <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/">university</a> for a degree in New Media &ndash; but I prefer to be a bit more precise with that declaration; what I <em>actually</em> study is front-end web development. I recently completed a five month placement at <a href="http://clock.co.uk/" title="Go to the Clock homepage">Clock, a web shop based just outside of London</a>, where I got the chance to work on web sites and applications for clients such as DC Thomson and ITV.</p>

    <p>On most occassions, you will find me sat contemplating in front of a DOM tree, figuring stuff out. I&rsquo;m never happier than when I&rsquo;m knees deep into a project, learning something new. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of building scalable, flexible and maintainable websites &ndash; not just your ordinary local school website, but large and complicated websites. I have adopted principles the likes of <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> and <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> for building my CSS, and I recently began to use the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> framework for building JavaScript webapps.</p>

    <p>I contribute code to <a href="http://OliverJAsh.github.com/">GitHub</a>, wherever I can. The <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/oliverjash.me">code for this site</a> is up on there, too, <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/oliverjash.me">if you're interested</a>. I post snippets of my thoughts on <a href="http://twitter.com/OliverJAsh">Twitter</a>. Away from the computer, I take an interest in travelling and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/OliverJAsh" title="See my photos on Flickr">some photography</a>. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or via  <a href="http://twitter.com/OliverJAsh">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <p>I really believe that computers can improve lives. I bear witness to it every day. But I believe we need to make technology more human. As a web developer, I want to be a part of that revolution.</p>
